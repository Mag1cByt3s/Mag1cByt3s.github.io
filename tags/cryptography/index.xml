Can you decrypt this? Download the file here. Wrap your answer with picoCTF{}, put underscores in place of pauses, and use all lowercase.
writeup Opening the file in ghex or sonic visualizer did not help
After reading the following article I decided to try to open it using audacity.

Next I tried to interpret the waves as morse code.</description></item><item><title>picoCTF - Cryptography - credstuff</title><link>https://blog.ppeinecke.de/posts/picoctf-cryptography-credstuff/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 14:02:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ppeinecke.de/posts/picoctf-cryptography-credstuff/</guid><description>Cryptography - credstuff - writeup description We found a leak of a blackmarket website&amp;rsquo;s login credentials. Can you find the password of the user cultiris and successfully decrypt it? Download the leak here. The first user in usernames.txt corresponds to the first password in passwords.txt. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.
writeup let&amp;rsquo;s write a python program that finds the corresponding password for the user &amp;lsquo;cultiris&amp;rsquo;</description></item><item><title>picoCTF - Cryptography - basic-mod1</title><link>https://blog.ppeinecke.de/posts/picoctf-cryptography-basic-mod1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 13:58:41 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.ppeinecke.de/posts/picoctf-cryptography-basic-mod1/</guid><description>Cryptography - basic-mod1 - writeup description We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think we have a working decrpytion scheme. Download the message here. Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an underscore. Wrap your decrypted message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
writeup Lets write a simple python program which reads the message into a string first.</description></item></channel></rss>
